•Files Created by plain2snt 
	• english.vcb consists of:
		- each word from the english corpus 
		- corresponding frequency count for each word 
		- an unique id for each word 

	• french.vcb 
		- each word from the french corpus 
		- corresponding frequency count for each word 
		- an unique id for each word 
		
	• frenchenglish.snt consists of: 
		- each sentence from the parallel english and french corpi translated into the unique number for each word

•Files Created by the mkcls package 
	• .vcb.classes files contains:
		- an alphabetical list of all words (including punctuation) 
		- each words corresponding frequency count 

	• .vcb.classes.cats files contains 
		- a list of frequencies 
		- a set of words for that corresponding frequency 

•Files created by GIZA++: 
	• Decoder.config 
		- file used with the ISI Rewrite Decoder (http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/rewrite-decoder)
	• ti.final 
		- file contains word alignments from the french and english corpus
		- word alignments are in the specific words unique id
		- the probability of that alignment is given after each set of numbers. E.g:
			3 0 0.237882 
			1171 1227 0.963072
	• actual.ti.final 
		- file contains word alignments from the french and english corpus 
		- words alignments are the actual words not their unique id’s 
		- the probability of that is alignment is given after each set of words. E.g.: 
			of NULL 0.237882 
			Austin Austin 0.963072
	• perp 
		- list of perplexity for each iteration and model 

	• trn.src.vcb 
		- list of french words with their unique id and frequency counts
		- similar to french.vcb 
	• trn.trg.vcb 
		- list of english words with their unique id and frequency counts 
		- similar to english.vcb
	• tst.src.vcb 
		- blank
	• tst.trg.vcb 
		- blank
	• a3.final 
		- table with the following format:
			• i j l m p ( i / j, l, m) 
				• j = position of target sentence 
				• i = position of source sentence 
				• l = length of the source sentence 
				• m = length of the target sentence 
				• p( i / j, l, m) = is the probability that a source word in position i is moved to position j in a 
									pair of sentences of length l and m
									
		- z.B:
			• 0 1 1 60 5.262135e-06 
				• 0 – indicates position of target sentence 
				• 1 – indicates position of source sentence 
				• 1 – indicates length of source sentence 
				• 60 indicates length of target sentence 
				• 5.262135e-06 – is the probability that a source word in position 1 is moved position 0 of 
				  sentences of length 1 and 60 

	• A3.final 
		- matches the english sentence to the french sentence and give the match an alignment score
	• t3.final 
		- table after all iterations of Model 4 training 
	• d3.final 
		– similar to a3.final with positions i and j switched 

	• D4.final 
		- distortion table for IBM-4 

	• d4.final 
		- translation table for Model 4 

	• n3.final 
		- contains the probability of the each source token having zero fertility,  one fertility, … N fertility 
	• p0-3.final 
		- probability of inserting null after a source word 
 
	• gizacfg 
		- contains parameter settings that were used in this training (training can be duplicated exactly)
